## Code Review

- Readability and maintainability: This is the first criterion and cannot be overstated enough.
- Uniform formatting: Whether the code with consistent indentation, spacing, and naming convention easy to understand?
- Testing and quality assurance: Whether it have meticulous testing and quality assurance processes?
- Boundary testing: Are we exploring extreme scenarios and boundary conditions to identify hidden problems?
- Security and performance: Are we ensuring security and performance in our source code?
- Architectural integrity: Whether the code is scalable, sustainable, and has a solid architectural design?

## Testing

- Smoke Testing: This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the APIs are working and nothing breaks.
- Functional Testing: This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected results.
- Integration Testing: This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested.
- Regression Testing: This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldn’t break the existing behaviors of APIs.
- Load Testing: This tests applications’ performance by simulating different loads. Then we can calculate the capacity of the application.
- Stress Testing: We deliberately create high loads to the APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally.
- Security Testing: This tests the APIs against all possible external threats.
- UI Testing: This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data can be displayed properly.
- Fuzz Testing: This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API vulnerabilities.

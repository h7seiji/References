# Data Types

## Fundamental Data Types

### Integer (int)

Integers are whole numbers that can store both positive and negative values. The size of int depends on the system architecture (usually 4 bytes).

```cpp
int num = 42;
```

There are variants of int that can hold different ranges of numbers:

- short (`short int`): Smaller range than int.
- long (`long int`): Larger range than int.
- long long (`long long int`): Even larger range than long int.

### Floating-Point (float, double)

- float: Provides single-precision floating-point numbers. It typically occupies 4 bytes of memory.

```cpp
float pi = 3.14f;
```

- double: Provides double-precision floating-point numbers. It consumes more memory (usually 8 bytes) but has a higher precision than float.

```cpp
double pi_high_precision = 3.1415926535;
```

### Character (char)

Characters represent a single character, such as a letter, digit, or symbol. They are stored using the ASCII value of the symbol and typically occupy 1 byte of memory.

```cpp
char letter = 'A';
```

### Boolean (bool)

Booleans represent logical values: true or false. They usually occupy 1 byte of memory.

```cpp
bool is_cpp_great = true;
```

## Derived Data Types

### Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type in consecutive memory locations.

```cpp
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

### Pointers

Pointers are used to store the memory address of a variable.

```cpp
int num = 42;
int* pNum = &num;
```

### References

References are an alternative way to share memory locations between variables, allowing you to create an alias for another variable.

```cpp
int num = 42;
int& numRef = num;
```

## User-Defined Data Types

### Structures (struct)

Structures are used to store different data types under a single variable and accessibility of member variables and methods are public.

```cpp
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
    float height;
};

Person p1 = {"John Doe", 30, 5.9};
```

### Classes (class)

Classes are similar to structures, but the accessibility of the member data and function are governed by access specifiers. By default access to members of a class is private.

```cpp
class Person {
public:
    std::string name;
    int age;

    void printInfo() {
        std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << std::endl;
    };
};

Person p1;
p1.name = "John Doe";
p1.age = 30;
```

### Unions (union)

Unions are used to store different data types in the same memory location.

```cpp
union Data {
    int num;
    char letter;
    float decimal;
};

Data myData;
myData.num = 42;
```

## Static Typing

n C++, static typing means that the data type of a variable is determined at compile time, before the program is executed. This means that a variable can only be used with data of a specific type, and the compiler ensures that the operations performed with the variable are compatible with its type. If there is a mismatch , the compiler will adjust the data type of variable to match another provided itâ€™s feasible . This process is known as Type Conversion. If compiler not able to achieve type conversion , Invalid Type Conversion error will be raised during compilation of the code .

C++ is a statically typed language, which means that it uses static typing to determine data types and perform type checking during compile time. This helps with ensuring type safety and can prevent certain types of errors from occurring during the execution of the program.

## Dynamic Typing in C++

C++ is known as a statically-typed language, which means the data types of its variables are determined at compile time. However, C++ also provides concepts to have certain level of dynamic typing, which means determining the data types of variables at runtime.

### `void*` Pointers

A void* pointer is a generic pointer that can point to objects of any data type. They can be used to store a reference to any type of object without knowing the specific type of the object.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 42;
    float y = 3.14f;
    std::string z = "Hello, world!";

    void* void_ptr;

    void_ptr = &x;
    std::cout << "int value: " << *(static_cast<int*>(void_ptr)) << std::endl;

    void_ptr = &y;
    std::cout << "float value: " << *(static_cast<float*>(void_ptr)) << std::endl;

    void_ptr = &z;
    std::cout << "string value: " << *(static_cast<std::string*>(void_ptr)) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### `std::any` (C++17)

C++17 introduced the std::any class which represents a generalized type-safe container for single values of any type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <any>

int main() {
    std::any any_value;

    any_value = 42;
    std::cout << "int value: " << std::any_cast<int>(any_value) << std::endl;

    any_value = 3.14;
    std::cout << "double value: " << std::any_cast<double>(any_value) << std::endl;

    any_value = std::string("Hello, world!");
    std::cout << "string value: " << std::any_cast<std::string>(any_value) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI)

Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI) is a feature in C++ that allows you to obtain the type information of an object during program execution. This can be useful when using dynamic typing, where the type of an object can change at runtime.

There are two main mechanisms for RTTI in C++:

- `typeid` operator
- `dynamic_cast` operator

## auto (Automatic Type Deduction)

`auto` is a keyword in C++ language introduced in C++11, which is used for automatic type deduction.
It automatically deduces the type of a variable from the type of its initializer expression at compile time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Traditional way of declaring a variable:
    int myInt = 5;

    // Using auto for type deduction:
    auto myAutoInt = 5; // Automatically deduces the type as 'int'

    // Example with more complex types:
    std::vector<int> myVector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Without auto, iterating the vector would look like this:
    for (std::vector<int>::iterator it = myVector.begin(); it != myVector.end(); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << std::endl;
    }

    // With auto, the iterator declaration becomes simpler:
    for (auto it = myVector.begin(); it != myVector.end(); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << std::endl;
    }
}
```

In C++14, you can also use auto with function return types to let the compiler automatically deduce the return type based on the returned expression:

```cpp
auto add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y; // The compiler deduces the return type as 'int'
}
```

## Type Casting

Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

### C-style casting

It is the syntax inherited from C, and it is done by simply putting the target data type in parentheses before the value to cast.

```cpp
int a = 10;
float b = (float)a;  // C-style cast from int to float
```

### static_cast

This is the most commonly used method for type casting in C++.
It is performed at compile time, and you should use it when you have an explicit conversion between data types.

```cpp
int a = 10;
float b = static_cast<float>(a);  // static_cast from int to float
```

### dynamic_cast

It safely converts pointers and references of a base class to its derived class and checks the validity of the conversion during runtime.
If the conversion is not valid (i.e., the object is not of the target type), it returns a null pointer instead of producing undefined behavior.

```cpp
class Base {};
class Derived : public Base {};

Base* base_ptr = new Derived();
Derived* derived_ptr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(base_ptr);  // dynamic_cast from Base* to Derived*
```

### reinterpret_cast

This cast changes the type of a pointer, reference, or an integer value.
It is also called a bitwise cast because it changes how the compiler interprets the underlying bits.
Use reinterpret_cast only when you have a deep understanding of what you're doing, as it does not guarantee that the resulting value will be meaningful.

```cpp
int* a = new int(42);
long b = reinterpret_cast<long>(a);  // reinterpret_cast from int* to long
```

### const_cast

This casting method is used to remove the const qualifier from a variable.
It is generally not recommended, but can be useful in certain situations where you have no control over the constness of a variable.

```cpp
const int a = 10;
int* ptr = const_cast<int*>(&a);  // const_cast from const int* to int*
*ptr = 20;  // Not recommended, use with caution
```

# Structs

## Struct Fields

Struct fields are accessed using a dot.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
 X int
 Y int
}

func main() {
 v := Vertex{1, 2}
 v.X = 4
 fmt.Println(v.X)
}
```

## Pointers to structs

Struct fields can be accessed through a struct pointer.

To access the field X of a struct when we have the struct pointer p we could write (*p).X.
However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just p.X, without the explicit dereference.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
 X int
 Y int
}

func main() {
 v := Vertex{1, 2}
 p := &v
 p.X = 1e9
 fmt.Println(v)
}
```

## Struct Literals

A struct literal denotes a newly allocated struct value by listing the values of its fields.

You can list just a subset of fields by using the Name: syntax. (And the order of named fields is irrelevant.)

The special prefix & returns a pointer to the struct value.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
 X, Y int
}

var (
 v1 = Vertex{1, 2}  // has type Vertex
 v2 = Vertex{X: 1}  // Y:0 is implicit
 v3 = Vertex{}      // X:0 and Y:0
 p  = &Vertex{1, 2} // has type *Vertex
)

func main() {
 fmt.Println(v1, p, v2, v3)
}
```

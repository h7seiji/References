# Packages

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package main.

This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "math/rand"
)

func main() {
 fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

## Imports

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

## Exported names

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package.

pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

Run the code. Notice the error message.

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "math"
)

func main() {
 fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```

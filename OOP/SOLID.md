- S — Single Responsibility Principle
  - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- O — Open-Closed Principle
  - Software entities (e.g., classes, modules) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This promotes the idea of extending functionality without altering existing code.
- L — Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Subtypes (derived classes) must be substitutable for their base types (parent classes) without altering the correctness of the program.
- I — Interface Segregation Principle
  - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. This principle encourages the creation of smaller, focused interfaces.
- D — Dependency Inversion Principle
  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This promotes the decoupling of components through abstractions and interfaces.

## IAM

## ElastiCache

Streamlines deployment and running of Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant caches in the cloud.

### Caching Strategies

- Lazy loading: loads data into the cache only when necessary.
- Write-through: adds data or updates data in the cache whenever data is written to the database.
- Adding TTL: Time to live (TTL) is an integer value that specifies the number of seconds until the key expires.

## Secrets Manager

Helps protect the credentials that are needed to access databases, applications,
services, and other IT resources. With Secrets Manager, you can rotate, manage, and retrieve database
credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets by
making a Secrets Manager API call, eliminating the need to hardcode sensitive information in plaintext. Secrets
Manager offers secret rotation with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon
DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility).

## AppSync

Simplifies application development by giving you the ability to create a flexible API to
securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more data sources. AWS AppSync is a managed
service that uses GraphQL to help applications get the exact data that they need. You can use AWS AppSync to
build scalable applications that require real-time updates on a range of data sources, including Amazon
DynamoDB.

## CDN

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers strategically positioned across different geographical locations that accelerates webpage loading for data-heavy applications.
Think of it as a distributed network of "content warehouses" - instead of having one central warehouse that everyone must visit, you have smaller warehouses placed closer to your customers.

### How CDNs Work

When a user visits a website, data typically has to travel across the internet from the server to reach their computer.
If the user is far from the server, this creates significant latency issues, especially for large files like videos or images.
CDNs solve this problem by storing copies of your website content on servers geographically closer to your users.

# Traceroute

Traceroute is a tool to trace the path between two hosts. A traceroute can be a helpful first step to uncovering many different types of network problems. Support or network engineers often ask for a traceroute when diagnosing network issues.

## Functionality

Traceroute shows all Layer 3 (routing layer) hops between the hosts. This is achieved by sending packets to the remote destination with increasing TTL (Time To Live) value (starting at 1). The TTL field is a field in the IP packet which gets decreased by one at every router. Once the TTL hits zero, the packet gets discarded and a "TTL exceeded" ICMP message is returned to the sender. This approach is used to avoid routing loops; packets cannot loop continuously because the TTL field will eventually decrement to 0. By default the OS sets the TTL value to a high value (64, 128, 255 or similar), so this should only ever be reached in abnormal situations.
So traceroute sends packets first with TTL value of 1, then TTL value of 2, etc., causing these packets to expire at the first/second/etc. router in the path. It then takes the source IP/host of the ICMP TTL exceeded message returned to show the name/IP of the intermediate hop. Once the TTL is high enough, the packet reaches the destination, and the destination responds.
The type of packet sent varies by implementation. Under Linux, UDP packets are sent to a high, unused port. So the final destination responds with an ICMP Port Unreachable. Windows and the mtr tool by default use ICMP echo requests (like ping), so the final destination answers with an ICMP echo reply.

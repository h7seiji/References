# Functions

- Functions in Python are first-class citizens. That means you can work with functions as you would with any other variable. You can pass them as arguments to other functions, return them from functions, and even store them in variables.
- Functions are objects. Objects are instances of classes and contain methods and attributes.

## Lambda functions

## Decorators

```python
def my_logger(fun):
    def _inner_decorator(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f'{fun.__name__} is being called!')
        return fun(*args, **kwargs)

    return _inner_decorator

@my_logger
def my_function(n):
    return sum(range(n))

print(my_function(5))
# my_function is being called!
# 10
```

## *args **kwargs

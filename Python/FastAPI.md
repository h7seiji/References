- Mongo + FastAPI: <https://www.mongodb.com/languages/python/pymongo-tutorial>

## Background Tasks

Tasks to be run after returning a response.

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


def write_notification(email: str, message=""):
    with open("log.txt", mode="w") as email_file:
        content = f"notification for {email}: {message}"
        email_file.write(content)


@app.post("/send-notification/{email}")
async def send_notification(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(write_notification, email, message="some notification")
    return {"message": "Notification sent in the background"}
```

## Lifespan Events

You can define logic (code) that should be executed before the application starts up. This means that this code will be executed once, before the application starts receiving requests.

The same way, you can define logic (code) that should be executed when the application is shutting down. In this case, this code will be executed once, after having handled possibly many requests.

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from fastapi import FastAPI


def fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
    return x * 42


ml_models = {}


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Load the ML model
    ml_models["answer_to_everything"] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
    yield
    # Clean up the ML models and release the resources
    ml_models.clear()


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)


@app.get("/predict")
async def predict(x: float):
    result = ml_models["answer_to_everything"](x)
    return {"result": result}
```

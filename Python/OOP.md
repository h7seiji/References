# OOP in Python

- Encapsulation allows you to bundle data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) within a class to create a cohesive unit. By defining methods to control access to attributes and its modification, encapsulation helps maintain data integrity and promotes modular, secure code.

- Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication.

- Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential functionality of an object. By enforcing a consistent interface, abstraction simplifies interactions with objects, allowing developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.

- Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different types as instances of the same base type, as long as they implement a common interface or behavior. Pythonâ€™s duck typing make it especially suited for polymorphism, as it allows you to access attributes and methods on objects without needing to worry about their actual class.

# Array

## Time complexity

- Access: O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- Search (sorted array): O(log(n))
- Insert: O(n)
- Insert (at the end): O(1)
- Remove: O(n)
- Remove (at the end): O(1)

## Techniques

- Sliding window
- Two pointers
- Traversing from the right
- Sorting the array
- Precomputation
- Index as a hash key
- Traversing the array more than once

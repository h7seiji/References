# Dynamic programming

Dynamic programming amounts to breaking down an optimization problem into simpler sub-problems, and storing the solution to each sub-problem so that each sub-problem is only solved once.

## Techniques

- Sometimes you do not need to store the whole DP table in memory, the last two values or the last two rows of the matrix will suffice.

1. Learn the STAR answer format
2. Prepare your answers to commonly asked questions
3. Prepare experiences to showcase fit to the company's culture / core values
4. Try out mock behavioral interviews
5. Use structured courses

## STAR Format

- Situation - The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation which you found yourself in
- Task - What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use "Target" rather than "Task". Job interview candidates who describe a "Target" they set themselves instead of an externally imposed "Task" emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance
- Action - What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were
- Results - What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and what did you learn? What steps did you take to improve after the experience?

## CARL Method

- Context: Similar to Situation—the overall context of what was happening, including how you were involved.
- Action: [same] The concrete steps you took to address the task—what you did, how you did it, and why you chose that approach.
- Result: [same] The outcome of your actions—what changed, what impact you made on the business.
- Learnings: What you learned or your reflections on the choices you made.

## Organize your key stories

Spend some time going through your past experiences, your resume, any performance reviews you may have access to, etc. and collect 3-5 projects that have high impact, high complexity, and high involvement by you.

Consider projects like these:

- High-Impact Projects: Major launches, significant refactors, system migrations, new product features, architecture decisions that influenced multiple teams.
- Challenging Situations: Tight deadlines, technical failures, team or interpersonal conflicts, ambiguous requirements, projects where success was uncertain.
- Leadership Moments: Mentoring others, driving cross-team initiatives, representing your team externally, times when others looked to you for direction.
- Learning Experiences: Mistakes that led to growth, feedback that changed your approach, skills you developed under pressure, times when you had to completely rethink your approach.

## Prepare answers to the Big Three Questions

- Tell me about yourself: this question opens almost any interview.
- Tell me about your favorite project/most impactful project/etc.: pick a project at the intersection of impact, scope, and your personal involvement.
- Tell me about time when you resolved a conflict: this is the most common soft skill question.

## Common evaluated values

- Motivation - What drives you? Ideal candidates are self-motivated, passionate about technologies and products that have a real impact.
- Ability to be Proactive - Are you able to take initiative? Given a difficult problem, are you able to figure out how to get it done and execute on it?
- Ability to work in an unstructured environment - How well are you able to take ownership in ambiguous situations? Or do you rely on others to be told what to do?
- Perseverance - Are you able to push through difficult problems or blockers?
- Conflict Resolution - How well are you able to handle and work through challenging relationships?
- Empathy - How well are you able to see things from the perspective of others and understand your motivations?
- Growth - How well do you understand your strengths, weaknesses and growth areas? Are you making a continued effort to grow?
- Communication - Are you able to clearly communicate your stories during the interview?

## Uber Values

### Go get it (Perseverance)

Bring the mindset of a champion

Our ambition is what drives us to achieve our mission. How we define a champion mindset isn’t based on how we perform on our best days, it’s how we respond on the worst days. We hustle, embrace the grind, overcome adversity, and play to win for the people we serve. Because it matters.

### Trip obsessed (Initiative)

Make magic in the marketplace

The trip is where the marketplace comes to life. The earner, rider, eater, carrier and merchant are the people who connect in our marketplace - and we see every side. This requires judgment to make difficult trade-offs, blending algorithms with human ingenuity, and the ability to create simplicity from complexity. When we get the balance right for everyone, Uber magic happens.

### Build with heart (Stakeholder)

We care

We work at Uber because our products profoundly affect lives and we care deeply about our impact. Putting ourselves in the shoes of the people who connect in our marketplace helps us build better products that positively impact our communities and partners. Our care drives us to perfect our craft.

### Stand for safety ()

Safety never stops

We embed safety into everything we do. Our relentless pursuit to make Uber safer for everyone using our platform will continue to make us an industry leader for safety. We know the work of safety never stops, yet we can and will challenge ourselves to always be better for the communities we serve.

### See the forest and the trees

Know the details that matter

Building for the intersection of the physical and digital worlds at global scale requires seeing the big picture and the details. Knowing the important details can change the approach, and small improvements can compound into enormous impact over time.

### One Uber

Bet on something bigger

It’s powerful to be a part of something bigger than any one of us, or any one team. That’s why we work together to do what’s best for Uber, not the individual or team. We actively support our teammates, and they support us - especially when we hit the inevitable bumps in the road. We say what we mean, disagree and commit, and celebrate our progress, together.

### Great minds don't think alike

Diversity makes us stronger

We seek out diversity. Diversity of ideas. Identity. Background. Experience. Education. When we understand the incredible diversity of the people who connect on our platform, we make better decisions that benefit the world.

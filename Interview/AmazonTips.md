# Coding Interview Tips -

- Your goal must be to provide the interviewer with the most optimal solution

- Ask clarifying questions to understand the requirements before you start to code

- should we optimize for time or space?

- does the input have any limits we should watch out for?

- can we assume anything else about the input besides what you've already said?

- You will be asked to determine the efficiency and runtime (time/space) complexity for all coding questions.

- Aim to optimize the efficiency of your code to make it run faster.

- You are almost guaranteed to be given time/space complexity guidelines for designing your code.

- You must be able to code fast but at the same time it must be clean, clear and concise.

- Use the programming language you're most comfortable with.

- Be ready to explain how its built-in structures and operations work under the hood, in case your interviewer is not very familiar with the language of choice.

- Be especially careful with concise built-in expressions that might have a linear cost underneath (such as list.delete(element) or list.search(element)'.

- Write Syntactically correct code

- Don't worry too much about a perfect, fully compliable syntax, but the code should be syntactically correct for the most part. If you don't recall a particular syntax construct, be clear with the interviewer about the assumptions you're making.

- Use proper variable naming functions.

- Interviewers do not consider pseudo code as a complete solution to a problem.

- Account for all edge cases and corner cases.

- Test code in your mind if possible.

# Data Structures and Algorithms Preparation -

- Please see attached excel spreadsheet that has all the common data structures.

- You must be able to explain the inner workings of common data structures and be able to compare and contrast their usage in various applications.

- You must be able to solve problems in Linear time.

- Please practice questions on Hacker Rank

- https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit

- YouTube Link for Data Structures, Algorithms and CS Concepts in general

- https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool

- Refresh your knowledge on the commonly used data structures –

- (e.g. arrays, queues, stacks, trees, hash tables, graphs)

- You must know the common algorithms such as

- Traversals

- Divide and conquer

- Breadth-first search vs. depth-first search and understand the tradeoffs for each.

- Sorting

- Absolute Must Haves in order of priority when solving practice problems-

- Hash Tables – you must be able to explain how internals of hash tables work for example hashing.

- Linked Lists

- Big O Notation - absolutely necessary — you will be asked to determine time/space complexity in almost all your interview questions, and how to optimize your code for better time/space complexity. You are almost guaranteed to be given time/space complexity guidelines for designing your code. You are extremely likely to see a question where the solution will involve the use of hash tables.

- Trees (especially Binary Search Trees) - be ready to explain how a binary search tree works a) if it's balanced and b) if it's not balanced.

- Algorithms: Breadth First Search/Depth First Search, Binary Search, Merge Sort and Quick Sort

- Arrays

- Recursion

- Stacks/Queues

- Bit Manipulation

- You will want to know recursion (remember the termination clause!!) and linked lists. Same for Stacks and Queues. Questions involving bit manipulation are rare but are encountered from time to time.

# Existing System Design:

- Be prepared to explain in architecture complexity about a project you are extremely proud of.

- Be prepared to explain what your role was in the project.

- Be prepared to explain the tradeoffs.

- Be prepared to explain the design of the software system, the technologies and framework you decided to implement or use on the project and why you decided to choose those.

- Be prepared to explain what was the most challenging part of the project and how did you manage to overcome it.

- Be prepared to explain the final result of the project – was it a success or failure?

## iptables

Iptables is a firewall program for Linux. It uses tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel to monitor and filter traffic from and to your server. Each table contains a number of chains, which are lists of rules that can match a set of packets. When a packet matches a rule, it is given a target, which can be another chain or a special value.

## tcpdump

The tcpdump command can be used to capture network traffic on a Linux system.

# CI/CD

## Do:

- Treat your infrastructure as code:
  - Use version control for your infrastructure code.
  - Make use of bug tracking/ticketing systems.
  - Have peers review changes before applying them.
  - Establish infrastructure code patterns/designs.
  - Test infrastructure changes like code changes.
- Put developers into integrated teams of no more than 12 self-sustaining members.
- Have all developers commit code to the main branch frequently, with no long-running feature branches.
- Consistently adopt a build system such as Maven or Gradle across your organization and standardize builds.
- Bake security into your code pipeline.
- Have developers build unit tests toward 100% coverage of the code base.
- Ensure that unit tests are 70% of the overall testing in duration, number, and scope.
- Ensure that unit tests are up-to-date and not neglected. Unit test failures should be fixed, not bypassed.
- Treat your continuous delivery configuration as code.
- Establish role-based security controls (that is, who can do what and when):
  - Monitor/track every resource possible.
  - Alert on services, availability, and response times.
  - Capture, learn, and improve.
  - Share access with everyone on the team.
  - Plan metrics and monitoring into the lifecycle.
- Keep and track standard metrics:
  - Number of builds.
  - Number of deployments.
  - Average time for changes to reach production.
  - Average time from first pipeline stage to each stage.
  - Number of changes reaching production.
  - Average build time.
- Use multiple distinct pipelines for each branch and team.

## Donâ€™t:

- Have long-running branches with large complicated merges.
- Have manual tests.
- Have manual approval processes, gates, code reviews, and security reviews.
